## Overview

Ralph ships as a pnpm monorepo (Node >= 20, pnpm >= 9, root `packageManager pnpm@9.12.0`) that produces three release components:

| Component             | Path                      | Version | What it is                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@daonhan/ralph-core` | `packages/core`           | 0.6.1   | Library: loop driver, docker runner, template renderer, stage registry, AFK machinery. ESM, TS → `dist/`.                                                                         |
| `@daonhan/ralph`      | `apps/cli`                | 0.6.1   | CLI exposing `ralph-afk`, `ralph-ghafk`, and opt-in `ralph-chief` bin entries. Hand-written JS bins, **no build step**, depends on core via `workspace:^`.                        |
| `ralph-sandbox`       | `packages/core/templates` | 0.2.1   | Synthetic component for the Docker image (`docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest`). Built from [`../packages/core/templates/Dockerfile`](../packages/core/templates/Dockerfile). |

Both packages are **ESM only** (`"type": "module"`). Relative imports inside [`../packages/core/src`](../packages/core/src) end in `.js` (compiled-output extension required by `moduleResolution: NodeNext`).

The harness drives a selectable Claude Code or Codex CLI against a target repository in an iterating **implementer → reviewer** loop. Claude is the default; `--agent codex` opts into Codex, and `RALPH_AGENT` is the fallback when the flag is absent. Every stage runs inside an **ephemeral `--rm` container** whose container filesystem is discarded. The host-mounted workspace, including scratch logs and uncommitted changes, and the selected provider's credential store persist across stages.

## End-to-end data flow

```
ralph-afk / ralph-ghafk / chief   bin (apps/cli/bin/*.js → import { runAfk|runGhAfk|runChief })
        │
        ▼
runAfk / runGhAfk                 (main.ts / gh-main.ts → runBin in run-bin.ts)
   parseFlags (cli-help.ts)       --agent/--codex-user-config/--help/-V/--print-config/AFK flags
   resolve workspaceDir, ralphDir, packageDir from env
   [--detach] detachAndExit       fork-and-exit, parent returns 0
        │
        ▼
runLoop (loop.ts)
   acquire() wake-lock (keepalive.ts)         once, unless --no-keep-alive
   install SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers + AbortController
   ensureImage(ralphDir, {signal})            ONCE before the loop
   for i in 1..iterations:
     for s in 0..stages.length-1:
        renderTemplate(...)  (render.ts)       expand tags → prompt string
        runStage(...)  (runner.ts)             wrapped in withRetries (retry.ts)
           writeFileSync(.run-*.md)
            select agents/{claude,codex} adapter
            spawn docker run … <provider command> …
            streamDocker: provider JSONL → normalized events → live print
                                   capture completion → return value
        if s == 0 and hasSentinel(result): print run summary, return
   finally: release wake-lock, off() signal handlers, [--notify] toast
```

The bin layer is thin: it parses flags, resolves three directories and the provider selection, and calls `runLoop` with a stage chain plus an `inputs` string. `runLoop` owns the iteration, signal handling, wake-lock, retries, and the sentinel gate without provider-specific branches. `renderTemplate` is a pure-ish synchronous string transform that may shell out to the **host** to expand tags. `runStage` is the only thing that talks to Docker; an agent adapter supplies the command, selected-provider credentials, environment, and JSONL decoder. `streamDocker` renders normalized assistant/tool/diagnostic events and returns the decoder's completion as the stage value.

The opt-in `ralph-chief` profile is a separate state machine and does not replace the legacy AFK chain:

```
TASK.md → CHIEF planning → WORKER → MACHINE_CHECK → CHIEF_REVIEW
                                      ↑                 │
                                      └ RETURN / PATCH ─┘
                         PASS / HUMAN_REQUIRED / MAX_ITERATIONS / TOKEN_BUDGET_EXCEEDED
```

`chief-loop.ts` reuses `runStage` and the existing provider adapters, while `machine-gate.ts` executes configured shell commands without a model. `git-guard.ts` protects the task, acceptance, `CHIEF.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` inputs. Chief output is strict JSON with `PASS`, `PATCH`, `RETURN`, or `HUMAN_REQUIRED`; a Chief code change always forces a new gate and review. Run artifacts are stored below `.ralph/chief-runs/<run-id>/`. With `chief_mode: external`, no Chief model is called: the run writes `CHIEF_HANDOFF.md`, enters `WAITING_FOR_CHIEF`, and resumes only from a validated `CHIEF_VERDICT.json`.

`ensureImage` runs exactly once, before the iteration loop, so a missing/floating image is resolved a single time per run.

Three resolved directories drive everything (set in `run-bin.ts`, shared by both bins):

| Dir            | Source                                    | Use                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspaceDir` | `RALPH_WORKSPACE` or `process.cwd()`      | Bind-mounted at `/home/agent/workspace`; host root for `.ralph-tmp/`. |
| `ralphDir`     | `RALPH_DOCKER_CONTEXT` or `packageDir`    | `docker build` fallback context.                                      |
| `packageDir`   | `resolve(dirname(import.meta.url), "..")` | The installed core package dir; `templates/` is read from here.       |

---

## Loop topology

Two chains, both first-stage-gated:

```
ralph-afk   → [STAGES.implementer,      STAGES.reviewer]   inputs = "<plan-and-prd>"
ralph-ghafk → [STAGES.ghafkImplementer, STAGES.reviewer]   inputs = ""
```

- **`ralph-afk` is plan/PRD-driven.** Its first positional arg is forwarded verbatim as the `{{ INPUTS }}` tag.
- **`ralph-ghafk` is GitHub-issue-driven.** No input arg; `inputs = ""` and the issue context is pulled by the template via `gh`.

**The first stage of a chain is always the gate.** After its stage runs, `loop.ts` checks the captured `result` for the exact literal sentinel on a line of its own:

```
<promise>NO MORE TASKS</promise>
```

On a hit the loop prints the `Ralph ended · no-more-tasks · …` summary line and returns immediately — subsequent stages do **not** run. The sentinel string is hardcoded as `SENTINEL` in [`../packages/core/src/loop.ts`](../packages/core/src/loop.ts) and matched by the exported `hasSentinel` predicate — surrounding whitespace and a wrapping pair of backticks are allowed, nothing else on the line — and the agent is told to emit it (see [`../packages/core/templates/prompt.md`](../packages/core/templates/prompt.md)) when no AFK tasks remain. A mention inside prose does not gate: the loop writes one `[warning] iteration <i>: the gate mentioned … without emitting it on a line of its own; the loop continues` line to stderr and keeps going. The **reviewer never gates** — only `s === 0` is sentinel-checked.

**Failure handling within an iteration:** each stage is wrapped in `withRetries`. If a stage exhausts its retry budget, `loop.ts` writes a `[failure]` marker to the stage log, prints a failure line, and `break`s out of the stage loop — abandoning the rest of _that_ iteration. The outer iteration loop then proceeds to the next iteration (`i + 1`). A stage failure does **not** abort the whole run.

## Module map

[`../packages/core/src`](../packages/core/src) holds the orchestration modules, provider adapters, and `__tests__/`.

Provider implementation details and `keepalive` / `detach` / `notify` / `retry` / `cli-help` are deliberately **not** part of the public surface.

---

## AFK machinery

Designed for unattended overnight runs. Four flags wire it up: `--no-keep-alive`, `--max-retries <N>`, `--detach` (+ `--log <path>`), `--notify`.

### Retries — [`retry.ts`](../packages/core/src/retry.ts)

`withRetries(fn, opts)` calls `fn` up to `max + 1` times. Default `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 3` (override with `--max-retries`; `0` disables retries / restores fail-fast). The backoff schedule is fixed:

```ts
export const DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MS = [5_000, 30_000, 120_000]; // 5s, 30s, 2m
```

`backoffMs[i]` is the wait **before** attempt `i+1`; once attempts exceed the array length the last value (`120_000`) repeats. `onAttempt(attempt, err)` fires after each failed attempt (before the wait) — `loop.ts` uses it to print a `[retry]` marker and append it to the stage log.

### Wake-lock — [`keepalive.ts`](../packages/core/src/keepalive.ts)

`acquire()` spawns a long-lived child that holds a system-sleep inhibitor for the loop's lifetime; `release()` kills it. Per platform:

| Platform | Mechanism                                                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `powershell` holding `SetThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS \| ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED)` in a sleep loop. |
| macOS    | `caffeinate -i -w <parentPid>`.                                                                      |
| Linux    | `systemd-inhibit --what=sleep --mode=block sleep infinity`.                                          |

A missing utility (`ENOENT`) or early child exit degrades to a no-op with a one-time `[keepalive]` warning — the loop never crashes. WSL2 is detected via `/proc/version` and warns that `systemd-inhibit` blocks WSL idle only, not the Windows host. Skip entirely with `--no-keep-alive`.

### Detach — [`detach.ts`](../packages/core/src/detach.ts)

`--detach` forks the bin into a background process (`spawn(execPath, [binEntry, ...argv], { detached: true })`), redirects child stdout+stderr to the log file, prints `detached pid <pid>, log <path>`, and exits the parent **0**. `stripDetachFlags` removes `--detach` and `--log <value>` from the re-spawned argv so the child cannot fork again. Default log path: `<workspace>/.ralph-tmp/logs/detached-<parent-pid>.log` (override with `--log`, only valid with `--detach`).

### Notify — [`notify.ts`](../packages/core/src/notify.ts)

`--notify` fires a best-effort OS toast + a terminal bell (`\x07` to stderr) on terminal events:

- `notifyComplete` on sentinel hit or iteration-cap reached.
- `notifyError` on SIGINT/SIGTERM or an uncaught loop error.

Toast backends: Windows BurntToast (fallback `msg.exe`), macOS `osascript display notification`, Linux `notify-send`. All fire-and-forget; missing utilities are swallowed.

### Signal handling — [`loop.ts`](../packages/core/src/loop.ts)

`runLoop` installs `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` handlers and an `AbortController` (`stageAbort`):

- **SIGINT** → abort the active stage, `notifyError("interrupted (SIGINT)")` if `--notify`, release wake-lock, `process.exit(130)`.
- **SIGTERM** → abort active stage, `notifyError("terminated (SIGTERM)")` if `--notify`, release wake-lock, `process.exit(143)`.

Aborting flows the `stageAbort.signal` into `runStage` / `ensureImage`; `streamDocker` and `runDockerCommand` listen for `abort` and **kill the docker child**, rejecting with an `AbortError`. The wake-lock is released through a single `releaseOnce` guard shared by both handlers and the `finally` block, so the inhibitor child is killed exactly once. Handlers are removed via `process.off` in `finally`.

---

## Template renderer

[`render.ts`](../packages/core/src/render.ts). Templates live in [`../packages/core/templates`](../packages/core/templates). `renderTemplate(templatePath, vars, opts)` reads the file and applies six tag forms **in this fixed order** (order matters — `@spill` resolves before shell tags, and the try-shell regex matches before the plain one):

| #   | Tag                                        | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `@include:<path>`                          | Inline a file via `readFileSync`. Relative paths resolve against the template's dir. **No shell.** Trailing newline trimmed. Used to inject the playbooks.                                                                                        |
| 2   | `@spill[?]:<name>=`<cmd[\|\|\|fallback]>`` | Run `cmd` on the host shell, write stdout to `spillHostDir/<name>`, and substitute the container-relative path `./<spillRefPath>/<name>` into the prompt. The `?` form treats non-zero exit as success and writes `fallback` instead of throwing. |
| 3   | `!?`<cmd[\|\|\|fallback]>``                | Try-shell. `execSync` with stderr suppressed; non-zero exit substitutes the literal `fallback` string. Matches **before** the plain `!` form.                                                                                                     |
| 4   | `!`<cmd>``                                 | Plain shell. `execSync` with `cwd = workspaceDir`. Failure **throws and aborts the iteration**.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | `{{ INPUTS }}`                             | Replaced with `vars.INPUTS` (the `inputs` string passed to `runLoop`).                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6   | `{{ HISTORY }}`                            | Replaced with `vars.HISTORY` — the last ten `.ralph/history/` stage entries (non-empty only for the implementer stage), substituted after the shell tags alongside `{{ INPUTS }}`.                                                                |

`resolveShell()`: `/bin/bash` on Linux/macOS; on Windows it walks `PATH` (`;`-split) for the first `bash.exe` (Git for Windows / WSL passthrough), falling back to `cmd.exe`. **Templates should prefer `!?` over `!`** for any command that may be unavailable on `cmd.exe`. Shell tags cap output at `maxBuffer = 64 MiB`.

**`@spill` security check:** the `<name>` must be a plain filename — any `/`, `\`, `.`, `..`, embedded `..`, or absolute path throws. Templates are trusted (shipped in the tarball) but this is defense-in-depth to keep writes confined to the per-iteration spill dir. `runLoop` supplies a fresh per-stage `spillHostDir` (`<workspace>/.ralph-tmp/spill-<pid>-<iter>-<stageIdx>-<ts>/`) and `spillRefPath` (`.ralph-tmp/spill-…`, POSIX) on every render; using `@spill` without them throws.

### What the shipped templates actually do

**[`afk.md`](../packages/core/templates/afk.md)** — try-shell for recent commits, the `{{ INPUTS }}` block, then `@include:prompt.md`:

```
!?`git log -n 5 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short|||No commits found`
...
{{ INPUTS }}
@include:prompt.md
```

**[`ghafk.md`](../packages/core/templates/ghafk.md)** — a **two-view issue model** to keep the prompt lean: an inline summary index plus a spilled full dump.

```
<issues-summary>
!?`gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --json number,title,labels|||[]`
</issues-summary>

<issues-full-file>
Full issue bodies + comments spilled to:
@spill?:issues.json=`gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --json number,title,body,labels,comments|||[]`
</issues-full-file>
@include:ghprompt.md
```

The agent triages from the inline `<issues-summary>`, then `Read`s the spilled `issues.json` (with `offset`/`limit`) for bodies/comments before picking a task — so large issue bodies never bloat the prompt token count.

**[`review.md`](../packages/core/templates/review.md)** — `HEAD`, recent commits, `git show --stat HEAD` inline, and the **full HEAD patch spilled** to `head.diff`:

```
!?`git rev-parse HEAD|||(no commits)`
!?`git show --stat HEAD|||No diff`
Full patch spilled to: @spill?:head.diff=`git show HEAD|||No diff body`
```

The reviewer reviews only the latest commit; emits `<review>OK</review>` / `<review>SKIP</review>` and stops, or fixes defects and commits a new `fix(review): …` (never amends). It runs only when the implementer stage moved HEAD; otherwise the loop records a `skipped` history entry and starts no container.

## Docker runner

[`runner.ts`](../packages/core/src/runner.ts).

### `docker run` argv shape

`runStage` writes the rendered prompt to `<workspace>/.ralph-tmp/.run-<pid>-<iter>-<ts>.md` (referenced as `./.ralph-tmp/<file>` inside the container, sidestepping the Windows ~32 KB argv limit), then assembles:

```
docker run --rm -i \
  -v <workspaceDir>:/home/agent/workspace \
  -w /home/agent/workspace \
  -e GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 \
  -e GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=safe.directory \
  -e GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=* \
  [ selected-provider credential mounts and env ] \
  [ -v <HOME>/.config/gh:/home/agent/.config/gh:ro ] \
  [ -v <core>/templates/skills:/home/agent/ralph-skills/.claude/skills:ro | :/home/agent/.agents/skills:ro ] \
  [ --mount type=volume,source=ralph-claude-home,target=/home/agent/.local,volume-label=ralph.kind=claude-home ] \
  [ -v <sock>:/var/run/docker.sock  --group-add <gid|0> ] \
  [ -v ralph-nm-<hash>:/home/agent/workspace[/<pkg-dir>]/node_modules … ] \
  [ -v ralph-pm-store:/home/agent/.pm-store \
    -e npm_config_store_dir=/home/agent/.pm-store/pnpm \
    -e npm_config_cache=/home/agent/.pm-store/npm ] \
  <IMAGE_REF> <selected-provider argv>
```

The selected-provider argv is one of:

```bash
# Claude (default) — the bash -c wrapper is dropped under RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0
bash -c 'claude update 1>&2 || true; exec "$0" "$@"' \
  claude --add-dir /home/agent/ralph-skills \
  --verbose --print --output-format stream-json \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions \
  [--model "${RALPH_MODEL:-<host ~/.claude/settings.json model, else claude-opus-5[1m]>}"] \
  "Read the full instructions from the file ./.ralph-tmp/<run-file> in the current workspace and execute them."

# Codex (isolated configuration by default)
codex exec --json --ephemeral \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --ignore-user-config \
  --model "${RALPH_MODEL:-gpt-5.6-sol}" \
  [-c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'] \
  "Read the full instructions from the file ./.ralph-tmp/<run-file> in the current workspace and execute them."
```

For Claude, the `bash -c` wrapper runs `claude update` before the stage's own command
(`exec "$0" "$@"` re-execs the argv that follows the script, `claude` being `$0`): the
image's CLI is a build-time snapshot while Claude Code releases roughly daily. The update's
report is redirected to stderr — it surfaces on the host as dim `docker  Checking for updates
to latest version...` / `docker  Claude Code is up to date (…)` lines — so stdout stays
reserved for the stream-json the runner decodes; a failed update (offline, registry down)
falls through to the installed version (`|| true`). The updated CLI persists across
containers in the `ralph-claude-home` volume described under the mounts below; measured cost
is one ~200 MB download (~20–35 s) for the first stage on a host, then a ~2 s version check
per stage. `RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0` drops both the wrapper and the volume mount, so the stage
runs the image's baked CLI (a stale volume left mounted would shadow a fresher image). Codex
has no equivalent.

For Claude, the `--model` value resolves as `RALPH_MODEL` → the model pinned by the
host's `~/.claude/settings.json` (`env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, else the `model` key `/model`
stored; its "(default)" entry stores no model) → `DEFAULT_CLAUDE_MODEL`
(`claude-opus-5[1m]`). Ralph sends the flag rather than deferring to the container: the
sandbox CLI's own built-in default is frozen at image build time (the per-stage
`claude update` refreshes it, but not under `RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0` or offline) and can lag the host
CLI's across model transitions, so an omitted `--model` silently downgrades the run.
`env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` is read because the bind-mounted settings file applies it inside
the container, where `--model` would otherwise outrank it.

The flag is omitted in exactly one case: host settings that enable
`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY`. Those
providers use their own model identifiers (Bedrock inference-profile IDs such as
`us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8`), so a first-party default would be rejected and the
container CLI resolves the model as it did before. A settings file that exists but
cannot be read or parsed is reported on stderr and in `--print-config` instead of being
treated as "no model chosen".

For isolated Codex, `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"'` is supplied with Ralph's
`gpt-5.6-sol` default when `RALPH_MODEL` is unset. With an explicit `RALPH_MODEL`, Codex
owns validation and a failure is terminal for that stage attempt—Ralph never retries with
another model. `--codex-user-config` removes `--ignore-user-config`; when `RALPH_MODEL` is
also unset, both model and reasoning effort come from `~/.codex/config.toml`.

- **Workspace mount + `-w`:** the host workspace is mounted read-write and set as the container's working directory.
- **Container-local `node_modules`:** [`sandbox-volumes.ts`](../packages/core/src/sandbox-volumes.ts) decides one docker volume per package directory of the workspace (root plus each nested `package.json`, walked four levels deep, skipping `node_modules/` and dot dirs) plus the shared `ralph-pm-store` store volume, so an install inside the sandbox writes a Linux tree into a volume instead of the bind mount (#128). Volume names are `ralph-nm-<sha256 prefix>` of workspace + relative path; provenance lives in the labels `ralph.kind=node-modules`, `ralph.workspace=<host dir>`, `ralph.path=<rel dir>` (the store volume carries `ralph.kind=pm-store`). `runStage` lists, creates and — because a fresh volume mounts `root:root` while the sandbox runs as UID 1000 — hands them to the sandbox user with one `docker run --rm --user 0:0 --entrypoint chown` container, once per process, failing the stage with a message naming `RALPH_ISOLATE_NODE_MODULES=0` if any step fails. Off on Linux by default; see the environment-variable table.
- **Git env injection:** `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/KEY_0/VALUE_0` forces `safe.directory=*` so git works against a bind-mount whose UID differs from the container user (a Windows-host pain point).
- **Credential mounts** (only if the host path exists, resolved against `HOME || USERPROFILE`) are selected-provider-only: Claude mounts `~/.claude` and `~/.claude.json` (**rw**); Codex mounts `~/.codex` (**ro**) at `/mnt/codex-creds` and injects `CODEX_HOME=/home/agent/.codex` — a setup script wrapped around the `codex` invocation copies `auth.json`, `config.toml`, and `AGENTS.md` (when present) into the container-local `CODEX_HOME` before exec, because a bind-mounted `CODEX_HOME` cannot host the unix socket / symlinks Codex creates at startup (EPERM on Docker Desktop for Windows). Codex's `auth.json` is a reusable secret available to the process. Both may mount `~/.config/gh` (**ro**).
- **Shipped skills mount:** `runStage` also mounts the installed core package's `templates/skills` directory (today one skill, `ralph-tdd`) at the container path the selected adapter's `skillsMount` returns, always **read-only**: `/home/agent/ralph-skills/.claude/skills` for Claude — whose argv then carries `--add-dir /home/agent/ralph-skills` — and `/home/agent/.agents/skills` for Codex. Both are container-local paths outside every bind mount, so no host directory is created and nothing lands in the workspace; the mount is added only when the host directory exists (`resolveSkillsMountArgs`).
- **Claude home volume:** for Claude, `runStage` also mounts the named volume `ralph-claude-home` at `/home/agent/.local` — where the native installer keeps `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<ver>` and the `~/.local/bin/claude` launcher symlink — so the CLI that `claude update` installs persists across containers. The adapter declares it via `volumeMounts()` (Codex returns `[]`) and `resolveAgentVolumeArgs` emits it as `--mount type=volume,source=ralph-claude-home,target=/home/agent/.local,volume-label=ralph.kind=claude-home`, right after the skills mount and before the `node_modules` volumes. Unlike those, it needs no `chown` or other preparation: docker creates it on first use and seeds it from the image's `/home/agent/.local`, already owned by the sandbox user. It is host-wide — one volume shared by every workspace and both bins, because it is a cache (two loops running at once share it; a concurrent update is a benign race) — and `docker volume ls --filter label=ralph.kind` lists it alongside the `node_modules` volumes; `docker volume rm ralph-claude-home` clears it. `RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0` drops the mount together with the update.
- **Approval bypass** is provider-specific: Claude receives stage `permissionMode=bypassPermissions`; Codex receives `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.

On Windows, the generic `HOME || USERPROFILE` resolution is a supported native
launch path for both providers: the Codex credential home never sits on the
NTFS bind mount (credentials are copied into the container-local `CODEX_HOME`
instead), so the historical `chmod`/`fchmod`/unix-socket `EPERM` failures do
not apply. Follow the same-shell rule — log in with the host CLI from the same
environment that launches Ralph. For `ralph-ghafk` under WSL, export
`GH_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/gh"` so the provider-independent GitHub config is
the one mounted read-only.

### Docker socket mount (default OFF)

`resolveDockerSocketMount()` bind-mounts the host Docker socket into the sandbox so **Testcontainers** (and any Docker API client) inside the container can spawn **sibling** containers on the host daemon.

`detectDockerSocketPath()` candidate order:

1. `RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK_PATH` (explicit).
2. `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///…` (parsed; `tcp://` / `npipe://` / `ssh://` unsupported for bind-mount).
3. `/var/run/docker.sock`
4. `$HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock` (Docker Desktop macOS 4.x+)
5. `$HOME/.colima/default/docker.sock`
6. `$HOME/.rd/docker.sock` (Rancher Desktop)
7. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock` (rootless Docker)
8. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock`

On Windows only the explicit overrides are considered, then it returns `/var/run/docker.sock` (Docker Desktop translates it via the WSL2 backend). **Group fixup:** on Linux it `statSync`es the socket and passes `--group-add <gid>` matching the host docker group; on Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) the socket surfaces as `root:root 0660`, so it passes `--group-add 0` (file-access group only — the agent process still runs as UID 1000).

**Default:** the socket is not mounted. **Opt-in:** `RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK=1`. **Security note:** mounting `docker.sock` grants the selected agent, which runs without interactive approval, root-equivalent access to the host Docker daemon. Disabling the mount removes host-Docker control, but persistent host-write exposure still includes the workspace and selected provider's read-write credential store; `~/.config/gh` remains read-only.

### Image resolution — `ensureImage`

`docker image inspect` → `docker pull` → `docker build` (fallback). The build fallback runs **only** if pull fails **and** a Dockerfile exists at the build context. `isFloatingRef(ref)` returns `true` for `:latest` or an untagged ref (and `false` for a `@sha256:` digest pin); a **floating ref is always re-pulled even when cached**, so republishing `:latest` (e.g. a newer .NET SDK) reaches users. `resolveDockerfile(ctx)` prefers `ctx/templates/Dockerfile`, then `ctx/Dockerfile`. `IMAGE_REF` = `RALPH_IMAGE` → `RALPH_IMAGE_TAG` (legacy) → `docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest`. `ensureImage` has a sync overload and an async (`{ signal }`) overload; `loop.ts` uses the async one so a signal can abort the pull/build.

### Provider JSONL streaming — `streamDocker`

`spawn("docker", args, { stdio: ["ignore","pipe","pipe"] })`. stdout is read line-by-line; lines starting with `{` are appended to the NDJSON log and `JSON.parse`d. The selected adapter decodes provider-specific JSONL into `init`, `assistant`, `thinking`, `tool-start`, `tool-result`, and `diagnostic` events plus an optional terminal `completion` or `failure`:

- **assistant text** → printed to **stdout** with a `●` bullet (the visible answer stream).
- **tools / thinking / init / diagnostics** → rendered to **stderr** (tool name + truncated input/result preview + elapsed ms).
- **Claude terminal contract:** a `result` event supplies its `result` string as completion.
- **Codex terminal contract:** the last completed `agent_message` becomes the completion only when `turn.completed` arrives. `turn.failed` and fatal `error` records reject immediately; a transient `Reconnecting… X/Y` `error` notice renders as a diagnostic and the turn continues; `turn.completed` without a final agent message rejects; a clean process exit without `turn.completed` also rejects.

Color is **TTY-gated and stream-split**: `USE_COLOR` (stderr) and `USE_COLOR_STDOUT` (stdout) are independent, so `ralph-ghafk 1 > out.txt` stays clean even on a TTY. ANSI is disabled when `NO_COLOR` is set or `TERM=dumb`.

**Post-completion grace timer:** when either decoder emits completion, a one-shot timer (`RALPH_RESULT_GRACE_MS`, default **30000 ms**; `0` disables) is armed. If the docker child emits its terminal JSONL but never exits, the timer kills the child and resolves with the captured completion so the loop is not hung. On non-zero exit, `streamDocker` rejects with the last ~40 stderr lines.

## Per-iteration scratch layout

Everything lands under `<workspace>/.ralph-tmp/` (gitignored):

```
<workspace>/.ralph-tmp/
├── .run-<pid>-<iter>-<ts>.md             rendered prompt (deleted in finally; may leak on SIGKILL)
├── spill-<pid>-<iter>-<stageIdx>-<ts>/   per-stage @spill outputs (deleted in finally)
│   └── <name>                            e.g. issues.json, head.diff
└── logs/
    ├── <ts>-iter<N>-<stage>.ndjson       full NDJSON stream log (kept)
    └── detached-<pid>.log                child stdout+stderr (only in --detach mode)
```

`.run-*.md` and `spill-*/` are removed in `runStage`'s `finally`; the NDJSON logs are kept for inspection. A leaked `.run-*.md` after a hard kill is safe to delete.

Separately, `runLoop` writes one Markdown history file per run under `<workspace>/.ralph/history/<yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss>-<bin>[-<branch>].md` (self-gitignored via its own `*` `.gitignore`, written once): a header on open, one entry per completed stage, a footer with run totals on exit. At every non-signal exit the driver also runs the sandbox-install check ([`host-check.ts`](../packages/core/src/host-check.ts): a `node_modules/.modules.yaml` store path under `/home/agent/`, a stray `.pnpm-store/`), printing the `[warning]` block on stderr and appending ` · warning: sandbox-install` to the footer. The last ten entries across all runs are loaded back into the implementer prompt as `{{ HISTORY }}`. This is harness-owned — only [`history.ts`](../packages/core/src/history.ts), driven by `loop.ts`, writes here (pure `fs` + tolerant `git` reads, never Docker).

---

## Conventions to preserve

- **ESM only.** Both packages are `"type": "module"`; relative imports in `packages/core/src` end in `.js` (NodeNext).
- **First stage is the gate.** Place gating stages at index 0 of any chain. The sentinel `<promise>NO MORE TASKS</promise>` is hardcoded in [`../packages/core/src/loop.ts`](../packages/core/src/loop.ts).
- **No build step for `apps/cli`.** Bins are hand-written JS that `import { runAfk } from "@daonhan/ralph-core"`. Keep the bin layer flat — don't add TS there.
- **`permissionMode` is always `bypassPermissions`** for sandbox stages — never `acceptEdits`. This supplies Claude's no-approval mode; Codex receives its provider-specific no-approval flag. With the Docker socket disabled, persistent host writes still include the workspace and, for Claude, the read-write credential store (Codex credentials are mounted read-only); GitHub CLI config is read-only.
- **Templates ship in the core tarball.** `packages/core/package.json` `files` includes `dist` and `templates` (the `Dockerfile` lives under `templates/`).
- **Adding a stage** = (1) extend `STAGES` in [`../packages/core/src/stages.ts`](../packages/core/src/stages.ts), (2) drop a new `*.md` in [`../packages/core/templates`](../packages/core/templates), (3) wire it into the chain in `main.ts` / `gh-main.ts`.

## Building, testing, and the sandbox image

Verification = typecheck + unit tests + manual bin invocation (no separate lint command; formatting runs via the pre-commit hook).

Build core (`apps/cli` has no build):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r build        # tsc -p packages/core/tsconfig.json → dist/
pnpm -r typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across the workspace
```

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm -r build
pnpm -r typecheck
```

Run tests (core: vitest; root: `node --test` over `scripts/*.test.mjs`):

```bash
pnpm --filter @daonhan/ralph-core test   # vitest run, src/__tests__/*.test.ts
pnpm test                                # root: node --test scripts/*.test.mjs
```

```powershell
pnpm --filter @daonhan/ralph-core test
pnpm test
```

The pre-commit hook ([`../.husky/pre-commit`](../.husky/pre-commit)) runs `pnpm exec lint-staged` (Prettier `--write` on staged files) then `pnpm typecheck`. The root `prepare` script is `husky || git config core.hooksPath .husky` so installs still work if Husky does not self-initialize.

Build the sandbox image locally from [`../packages/core/templates/Dockerfile`](../packages/core/templates/Dockerfile) (`node:22-bookworm` + Debian Bookworm Python 3.11 exposed as `python`/`python3` + `python -m venv` + pinned `uv`/`uvx` 0.11.28 + git/curl/jq + .NET SDK 10 + `gh` + Claude Code and pinned Codex CLIs; base `node` user renamed to `agent` UID 1000; `safe.directory=*` global; `WORKDIR /home/agent/workspace`; `ENTRYPOINT []`, `CMD ["claude"]`):

```bash
docker build -t docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest \
  -f packages/core/templates/Dockerfile .
```

```powershell
docker build -t docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest `
  -f packages/core/templates/Dockerfile .
```

The Claude Code CLI in the image is a build-time snapshot; every Claude stage refreshes it with
`claude update` at run time and caches the result in the `ralph-claude-home` volume (see the
`docker run` argv shape), unless `RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0`.

Python runtime selection is static: the image supplies one baked system Python,
and the runner does not inspect `.python-version`, `.tool-versions`, `.mise.toml`,
`pyproject.toml`, or similar manifests. Repositories pinned to another version
must use a custom image until detection support exists. Project dependencies
belong in a project-local virtual environment or uv-managed isolation, not in the
Debian system Python.

Diagnose resolved config (workspace / docker context / image / socket) without launching Docker:

```bash
ralph-afk --print-config
```

```powershell
ralph-afk --print-config
```

Release/publishing (release-please → tag-driven npm + image workflows) is the single-source-of-truth concern of [`../RELEASING.md`](../RELEASING.md).

Claude falls back to the model pinned in host `~/.claude/settings.json`, then Ralph's default; under `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`/`_VERTEX`/`_FOUNDRY` the container CLI resolves instead. Explicit invalid models fail without fallback. |
