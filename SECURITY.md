# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately via GitHub Security Advisories — open the repository's
**[Security → Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/daonhan/ralph/security/advisories/new)**
form — or email **daonhan@gmail.com**. Include a description, reproduction steps, and the
affected version. You'll get an acknowledgement within a few days and a fix or mitigation plan.

## Supported versions

Only the latest published minor of each package (`@daonhan/ralph`, `@daonhan/ralph-core`) and
the latest `ralph-sandbox` image are supported with security fixes. Pin by digest for the image
and by exact version for the packages if you need reproducibility.

## Threat model — read before running

Ralph is an **autonomous agent harness**. By design it runs the selected coding
agent without interactive approval inside the sandbox container:

- Claude uses `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`.
- Codex uses `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.

Treat everything Ralph ingests as instructions the selected agent may execute.
The trust boundary is:

- **Only run Ralph against repositories, plans/PRDs, and GitHub issues you trust.** The plan/PRD
  string (`{{ INPUTS }}`), issue bodies/comments (`ralph-ghafk`), and commit messages are all
  fed to the selected agent running without interactive approval. `ralph-ghafk` in particular
  pulls **public GitHub issues** — text authored by strangers — into that agent. Do not point it
  at a repo whose open issues you have not vetted.

- **The host Docker socket is disabled by default.** Set `RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK=1` only for a
  trusted project that requires Testcontainers. When enabled, the mount grants the sandbox
  **root-equivalent access to the host Docker daemon** (it can start a sibling container that
  bind-mounts the host filesystem as root). Leaving it disabled removes host-Docker control,
  but persistent host-write exposure still includes the bind-mounted workspace and, for Claude,
  the read-write credential store. `~/.config/gh` remains read-only.

- **Selected-provider host credentials are bind-mounted.** Claude mounts
  `~/.claude` and `~/.claude.json` read-write; the agent can read or overwrite
  those reusable credentials. Codex mounts `~/.codex` read-only at
  `/mnt/codex-creds` and copies `auth.json` (plus `config.toml` and `AGENTS.md`
  when present) into a container-local `CODEX_HOME`; the agent cannot modify
  the host Codex store, but `auth.json` remains a readable reusable secret.
  `~/.config/gh` is mounted read-only. Isolated Codex configuration prevents
  personal config, MCP, and hook loading; it does not conceal
  `~/.codex/auth.json` from the process.

- **Ralph's own shipped skills are mounted read-only.** The `templates/skills/`
  directory of the installed `@daonhan/ralph-core` (today one skill, `ralph-tdd`)
  is bind-mounted into every stage at a container-local path — Claude
  `/home/agent/ralph-skills/.claude/skills`, Codex `/home/agent/.agents/skills`.
  It holds only Ralph's own shipped files, contains no secrets, and the agent
  cannot modify it or the host copy. No host directory is created by the mount.

- **The Claude sandbox fetches its CLI from the network at run time.** Every Claude
  stage runs `claude update` before its own command, downloading the Claude Code
  binary with the same trust as the `curl … install.sh` the image build runs, and
  caches it in the host-wide named Docker volume `ralph-claude-home` (shared by every
  workspace on the host, mounted at `/home/agent/.local`). Set `RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0`
  to pin the stage to the image's baked copy and drop the volume mount.

### Reducing blast radius

- Leave the default socket setting disabled. Set `RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK=1` only when you specifically need Testcontainers.
- Run Ralph on a disposable VM / dedicated machine, not your primary workstation, for untrusted
  inputs.
- Review open issues before running `ralph-ghafk`.
- Use a scoped, short-lived `gh` token.

## Template authoring (contributors)

The prompt-template renderer (`render.ts`) executes the **command bodies** of the `` !`cmd` ``,
`` !?`cmd` ``, and `@spill` tags on the **host shell**. The shipped templates only ever use
**static** command strings, and `{{ INPUTS }}` is substituted last (written to a file the agent
reads inside the container, never re-shelled on the host) — so there is no host command-injection
vector today. **This invariant must be preserved:** never interpolate runtime or untrusted data
into a tag command body. Doing so would create direct host RCE.
