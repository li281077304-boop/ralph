Ralph drives Claude Code by default, or Codex when selected with
`--agent codex`, against a target repository in an iterating implementer →
reviewer pipeline isolated inside a custom Docker image.

> ⚠️ **Security:** Ralph runs the selected agent without interactive approval inside the sandbox (`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` for Claude; `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for Codex). The host Docker socket is **disabled by default**; set `RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK=1` only for trusted projects that need Testcontainers. Enabling it grants root-equivalent access to the host Docker daemon. See **[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)** for the full threat model.

- **[`@daonhan/ralph-core`](./packages/core)** — library: iteration loop, docker runner, template renderer, stage registry. Importable from any Node project.
- **[`@daonhan/ralph`](./apps/cli)** — CLI: exposes `ralph-afk`, `ralph-ghafk`, and the opt-in `ralph-chief` bin entries. Depends on `@daonhan/ralph-core`.

Two AFK entry points (both installed globally after `npm i -g @daonhan/ralph`):

- **`ralph-afk`** — plan/PRD-driven loop. Hand it a plan + PRD string; iterates until the agent emits the sentinel `<promise>NO MORE TASKS</promise>` on a line of its own.
- **`ralph-ghafk`** — GitHub-issue-driven loop. Pulls open issues with `gh issue list` and lets the agent pick the next AFK task.

Convenience shims live at [`apps/cli/scripts/afk.sh`](./apps/cli/scripts/afk.sh) and [`apps/cli/scripts/ghafk.sh`](./apps/cli/scripts/ghafk.sh) — thin wrappers that fall back to `npx @daonhan/ralph` if not installed.

Agent playbooks: [`packages/core/templates/prompt.md`](./packages/core/templates/prompt.md) (for `ralph-afk`) and [`packages/core/templates/ghprompt.md`](./packages/core/templates/ghprompt.md) (for `ralph-ghafk`). Reviewer instructions: [`packages/core/templates/review.md`](./packages/core/templates/review.md). All three ship inside `@daonhan/ralph-core`.

## Architecture (AFK loops)

```
ralph-afk / ralph-ghafk / ralph-chief  (bin entries from @daonhan/ralph, on PATH after `npm i -g`)
   │

@daonhan/ralph (CLI, apps/cli)        bin: ralph-afk, ralph-ghafk, ralph-chief; scripts: afk.sh, ghafk.sh shims
   │ imports
   ▼
@daonhan/ralph-core (packages/core)
   ├── runAfk / runGhAfk              (env-driven entry: argv → runLoop)
   ├── runLoop                        (drives stage chain per iteration; checks sentinel)
   ├── render                         (renderer: @include / @spill / !? / !`cmd` / {{ INPUTS }})
   ├── stages                         (stage registry: implementer, ghafkImplementer, reviewer)
   └── runner                         (docker run → NDJSON stream → live print → final result)
   │
   ▼
docker run ralph-sandbox <selected-agent> …
```

Each iteration runs the stage chain `[implementer, reviewer]`. The implementer is the "gate": if it emits `<promise>NO MORE TASKS</promise>`, the loop exits before the reviewer runs.

Prompt templates expand six tag forms before each stage runs, in order — `@include:` (inline a file, no shell), `@spill[?]:` (run a command, write its output to a side file the agent `Read`s), `` !?`cmd|||fallback` `` (try-shell), `` !`cmd` `` (host shell), `{{ INPUTS }}` (the entry CLI's input arg — the plan/PRD string for `ralph-afk`, empty for `ralph-ghafk`), and `{{ HISTORY }}` (the last few stage outcomes from `.ralph/history/`, injected into the implementer prompt). Full semantics under [Change the template syntax](#change-the-template-syntax); the runtime model lives in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Chief/Worker execution profile

The Chief/Worker profile keeps the same local, Git-backed safety model while making the roles explicit: a Chief turns the task into a bounded Worker assignment, the Worker edits the repository, machine gates run independently, and the Chief reviews the evidence. A Worker report is never treated as proof that a gate passed.

The short status card printed for a run is intentionally readable:

```text
【总工进展】

当前目标：实现订单导出
现在在干什么：CHIEF_REVIEW
为什么：Worker 已完成，正在审计机器证据
机器验收：PASS
总工判断：等待最终审计
风险：无新增风险
需要你做什么：无需操作
下一步：Chief 返回 PASS 或下一轮施工任务
```

Terminal outcomes are similarly compact: `PASS`, `RETURN` (the Chief asks for a bounded follow-up), `PATCH` (a review patch changed the tree and gates/review must run again), `HUMAN_REQUIRED`, `FAILED`, `MAX_ITERATIONS`, or `TOKEN_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`. A human pause includes a decision card rather than silently guessing:

```text
【需要你拍板】

问题：Which retention policy should this migration use?
证据：.ralph/chief-runs/<run-id>/iterations/02/
GPT 总工判断：现有代码与两份政策文件冲突
推荐：选择组织已确认的保留期限
选项：
A 90 days
B 365 days
C 查看更多证据
```

The acceptance contract is kept outside the Worker prompt. `TASK.md`, `ACCEPTANCE.yaml`/`ACCEPTANCE.yml`, `CHIEF.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` are protected inputs; changing them is a Git Guard violation that stops the run. Reviewers must return a structured verdict. `RETURN` keeps the task in the loop with its context; `PATCH` invalidates the previous gate/review evidence and forces both to run again; `HUMAN_REQUIRED` persists the question and stops without committing or pushing.

### Chief/Worker configuration

The exact config keys are shown in the checked-in example for the current release. The important controls are bounded iterations, a token budget, independent gate commands, per-stage model settings, and Git Guard limits for unexpected diff growth. Keep the machine acceptance command in the config, not in a model-generated file. A minimal profile looks like:

```yaml
max_iterations: 6
max_total_tokens: 300000
chief_mode: codex # or external
chief:
  agent: codex
  model: gpt-5.6-sol
  reasoning_effort: high
worker:
  agent: codex
  model: gpt-5.6-terra
commands:
  - pnpm -r typecheck
  - pnpm -r test
```

Run it with `ralph-chief --repo /path/to/repo --task /path/to/TASK.md --config /path/to/ACCEPTANCE.yaml` and inspect the generated `.ralph/chief-runs/<run-id>/` evidence directory. Docker socket access is disabled by default in the Chief/Worker profile; opt in only for a trusted project that genuinely needs sibling containers. The profile does not use GUI automation, clipboard automation, browser clicks, or ChatGPT/Codex app windows, and it does not automatically commit or push.

For ordinary development where ChatGPT is the external Chief, set
`chief_mode: external` (or pass `--chief-mode external`). Ralph runs the Worker and
Machine Gate once, then stops at `WAITING_FOR_CHIEF` without calling a local Chief model.
Read `.ralph/chief-runs/<run-id>/CHIEF_HANDOFF.md`, save the external decision as
`CHIEF_VERDICT.json`, and resume with:

```bash
ralph-chief resume <run-id> --repo /path/to/repo
```

The external verdict must be strict JSON with `PASS`, `PATCH`, `RETURN`, or
`HUMAN_REQUIRED`, plus the exact `run_id`, `iteration`, and `handoff_hash` shown by the
handoff. A `PASS` must also include an authoritative `previousGate` whose `passed` value is
`true`. `PATCH` and `RETURN` must include a `worker_task`; external Chief code changes are
never faked locally. Verdict files are consumed after a successful resume, and any workspace
change invalidates the handoff. An invalid, stale, reused, or missing verdict stops explicitly
and never falls back to Codex Chief.

### Upstream basics

This repository is based on the upstream Ralph loop. Keep upstream-compatible changes small and documented: preserve the first-stage gate invariant, the provider adapter boundary, the `.ralph/history/` ownership rule, and the existing CLI entry points. When syncing upstream, review the diff around `packages/core/src/loop.ts`, `runner.ts`, `agents/`, `stages.ts`, templates, and security documentation before resolving conflicts. Run `pnpm -r typecheck` and `pnpm -r test` after the sync; do not copy generated `dist/` output or local run artifacts into the branch.

At runtime, the host workspace gets a `.ralph-tmp/` directory containing the per-iteration prompt files and `logs/*.ndjson`, plus a `.ralph/history/` directory holding one Markdown history file per run. Both are gitignored (`.ralph/history/` via its own `.gitignore`).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** — Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux). The orchestrator shells out to `docker build` / `docker run`.
- **Node.js 20+** + **npm 9+** (or `pnpm`/`yarn`). For Windows: native nvm-for-windows, nvm-windows, directly from nodejs.org, or Node inside WSL. For macOS/Linux: nvm, asdf, or a distro package.
- **`gh`** authenticated (only required for `ralph-ghafk`): `gh auth login` once.
- **Claude Code or Codex** authentication for the provider you select. See "First-run setup" below.
- **(Windows, optional but recommended)** `bash.exe` on PATH — comes free with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). The renderer prefers it over `cmd.exe` because POSIX redirects + utilities (`git log`, `gh issue list`) are smoother. If absent, the renderer falls back to `cmd.exe` and uses the built-in try-shell tag (`!?\`cmd|||fallback\``) so commands that fail return their fallback string cleanly — no broken render.

### Supported shells / OS combinations

| Where you invoke `ralph-afk` | Claude | Codex | Notes                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux native (Ubuntu, etc.)  | ✓      | ✓     | `/bin/bash` is used for shell tags.                                               |
| macOS native                 | ✓      | ✓     | `/bin/bash` is used.                                                              |
| Windows PowerShell / cmd     | ✓      | ✓     | Native Windows is supported for both providers.                                   |
| Windows + WSL bash           | ✓      | ✓     | Install Ralph, the selected host CLI, and credentials inside the same WSL distro. |
| Windows + Git Bash           | ✓      | ✓     | Native Git Bash and its Windows home are supported for both providers.            |

### Windows + WSL: credentials

Credentials live on the **host** at `~/.claude` or `~/.codex` (for the selected provider) and `~/.config/gh`, then get bind-mounted into the container. The path resolves per the shell that launches `ralph-afk`:

| Launch from              | `$HOME` is                        | Mounted into container                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows PowerShell / cmd | `C:\Users\<name>`                 | The selected provider's credential store under this home is mounted |
| WSL bash                 | `/home/<linuxname>`               | The selected provider's credential store under this home is mounted |
| Linux / macOS            | `/home/<name>` or `/Users/<name>` | The selected provider's credential store under this home is mounted |

Codex works from native Windows shells and WSL alike: Ralph mounts `~/.codex`
read-only at `/mnt/codex-creds` and copies `auth.json` (plus `config.toml` and
`AGENTS.md` when present) into a container-local `CODEX_HOME` before each
stage, so the credential home never sits on an NTFS-backed bind mount. Log in
with the host Codex CLI (`codex login`) from the same shell environment that
launches Ralph.

If you already logged in via PowerShell `claude.exe` and want WSL to use those creds too:

```bash
# WSL bash — replace <WINUSER>
mkdir -p ~/.claude
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/<WINUSER>/.claude/. ~/.claude/
cp /mnt/c/Users/<WINUSER>/.claude.json ~/.claude.json 2>/dev/null || true
mkdir -p ~/.config/gh
# gh on native Windows stores config in AppData/Roaming/GitHub CLI; fall back to .config/gh
cp -r "/mnt/c/Users/<WINUSER>/AppData/Roaming/GitHub CLI/." ~/.config/gh/ 2>/dev/null || \
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/<WINUSER>/.config/gh/. ~/.config/gh/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

- Launching Claude from PowerShell after a global install — just call the bin directly:
  ```powershell
  ralph-afk "<plan-and-prd>" 3
  ```
- Or from inside WSL bash:
  ```bash
  ralph-afk "<plan-and-prd>" 3
  ```

---

## Choose the coding agent

Claude remains the default:

```bash
ralph-afk "./docs/plans/x.md ./docs/prd/x.md" 5
```

Select Codex per invocation:

```bash
ralph-afk --agent codex "./docs/plans/x.md ./docs/prd/x.md" 5
ralph-ghafk --agent codex 5
```

For automation, `RALPH_AGENT=codex` is the fallback when `--agent` is absent.
The explicit flag always wins.

Codex ignores `~/.codex/config.toml` by default while still reusing its login.
Pass `--codex-user-config` to load that configuration intentionally. This may
start configured MCP servers and hooks, so their commands and paths must work
inside the Linux sandbox.

`RALPH_MODEL` applies to the selected agent. For Claude the model resolves as
`RALPH_MODEL` → the model pinned by the host's `~/.claude/settings.json`
(`env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, else the `model` key `/model` stored; its "(default)"
entry stores no model) → `claude-opus-5[1m]`, Ralph's own default. Ralph passes
`--model` rather than letting the container choose, because the sandbox image's
CLI is frozen at image build time and its built-in default can lag the host's
(the per-stage `claude update` refreshes the CLI, but not under
`RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0` or offline — see "Troubleshooting").
The exception is third-party routing: when the host settings enable
`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, or
`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY`, model IDs are provider-specific, so Ralph sends no
`--model` and the container CLI resolves as before. Isolated Codex defaults to
`gpt-5.6-sol` with high reasoning when `RALPH_MODEL` is unset. In inherited
configuration mode, an unset model and reasoning effort come from
`~/.codex/config.toml`. An explicit invalid model fails; Ralph never reruns the
stage with another model.

## First-run setup

### 1. Get the image

The orchestrator resolves the image in three steps on each run:

1. `docker image inspect $RALPH_IMAGE` — short-circuits if the image is already on the host (a floating tag like `:latest` is re-pulled anyway, so a republished sandbox isn't pinned to a stale local copy).
2. Otherwise `docker pull $RALPH_IMAGE` — defaults to `docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest`.
3. If pull fails AND `$RALPH_DOCKER_CONTEXT/Dockerfile` exists, falls back to `docker build -t $RALPH_IMAGE $RALPH_DOCKER_CONTEXT`.

For most users step 2 is enough — no local Dockerfile needed. To prime the cache:

```bash
docker pull docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest
```

Build locally (offline, custom changes):

```bash
cd ralph
docker build -t docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest -f packages/core/templates/Dockerfile .
```

The image bundles Node 22, Debian Bookworm Python 3.11 as `python` and `python3`,
`python -m venv`, `uv`/`uvx` 0.11.28, .NET SDK 10, `gh`, `jq`, `git`, Claude Code,
and the pinned Codex CLI. Basic Python repositories need no extra runtime install. Create a
project-local virtual environment (for example, `.venv`) or use uv-managed
isolation; do not install project dependencies globally into the Debian system
Python.

This release provides one baked system Python and does not select versions from
`.python-version`, `.tool-versions`, `.mise.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, or similar
manifests. Repositories pinned to another Python version need a custom
`RALPH_IMAGE` until future version-detection support is added.

The Claude Code CLI baked into the image is likewise a build-time snapshot, but
Claude Code releases roughly daily, so every Claude stage runs `claude update`
before its own command and caches the result in the host-wide `ralph-claude-home`
Docker volume; `RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0` runs the image's copy as shipped. See
"Troubleshooting" for the cost and cleanup.

#### Publishing a new image (maintainers)

The repo ships a GitHub Actions workflow at [`.github/workflows/publish-image.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-image.yml) that builds + pushes `linux/amd64` images to Docker Hub.

The Python runtime and tooling addition is a `ralph-sandbox` image release only;
it does not bump `@daonhan/ralph-core` or `@daonhan/ralph`.

Triggers:

- **`workflow_dispatch`** — manual run from the Actions tab; pick the tag and whether to also push `:latest`.
- **Git tag `ralph-sandbox-v*`** — pushing a tag like `ralph-sandbox-v0.1.3` (cut by release-please) publishes `:v0.1.3` plus `:latest`, and enriches the matching GitHub Release with the image digest, an SBOM, and a keyless cosign attestation.
- **Git tag `image-v*`** — legacy compatibility shim; publishes `:vX.Y.Z` plus `:latest` but does **not** enrich a GitHub Release. Slated for removal after one release cycle through the new path.

Required repo secrets: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (a Docker Hub access token with `Read & Write` scope on the `daonhan/ralph-sandbox` repository).

### 2. Authenticate (one-off)

The image is stateless. Provider credentials live on the **host** at `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`. If you use `ralph-ghafk`, its provider-independent GitHub CLI credentials live at `~/.config/gh`. The orchestrator mounts only the selected provider's credentials, plus GitHub CLI credentials when present, into each container.

> **Same-shell rule.** `ralph-afk` / `ralph-ghafk` read `$HOME` of the shell that launched them. Auth from the same shell context you intend to run the bins in. PowerShell host (`C:\Users\<you>\.config\gh\`) and WSL host (`\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<you>\.config\gh\`) are separate stores — don't mix. Native PowerShell and Git Bash homes are valid for both providers.

Choose one provider login path below. Claude and Codex authentication are
mutually exclusive; GitHub authentication is provider-independent and required
only for `ralph-ghafk`.

#### Claude login

##### Linux / macOS / WSL bash

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
touch ~/.claude.json

docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$HOME/.claude:/home/agent/.claude" \
  -v "$HOME/.claude.json:/home/agent/.claude.json" \
  docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest bash
```

##### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.claude" | Out-Null
if (-not (Test-Path "$HOME\.claude.json")) { New-Item -ItemType File "$HOME\.claude.json" | Out-Null }

docker run -it --rm `
  -v "${HOME}\.claude:/home/agent/.claude" `
  -v "${HOME}\.claude.json:/home/agent/.claude.json" `
  docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest bash
```

##### Inside the container

```bash
claude /login         # browser flow; Claude only
exit
```

#### Codex login

Use this path instead when you select Codex. Install the host CLI version
pinned in Ralph's sandbox from the same shell environment that will launch
Ralph:

```bash
npm install --global @openai/codex@0.144.4
codex --version
```

Codex credentials must be file-backed because a host OS keyring is not
available inside Docker. Create `~/.codex/config.toml` if needed and set:

```toml
cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"
```

Then authenticate in that same shell:

```bash
codex login
codex login status
```

Ralph mounts `~/.codex` read-only at `/mnt/codex-creds` and copies `auth.json`
(plus `config.toml` and `AGENTS.md` when present) into a container-local
`CODEX_HOME=/home/agent/.codex` before each stage. Codex therefore never writes
to the host credential store: an OAuth token refreshed inside the container is
not written back, and the host CLI re-refreshes on its next use. Ralph runs
Codex with `--ephemeral`, so stage session transcripts are not persisted
either.

#### GitHub login (`ralph-ghafk` only)

Skip this section when you use only `ralph-afk`. For `ralph-ghafk`, authenticate
GitHub regardless of whether you selected Claude or Codex. Ralph renders issue
data with the host `gh` command, then mounts the same configuration read-only at
`/home/agent/.config/gh` for the stage.

##### Linux / macOS / WSL bash

```bash
export GH_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/gh"
mkdir -p "$GH_CONFIG_DIR"
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

##### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$env:GH_CONFIG_DIR = "$HOME\.config\gh"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $env:GH_CONFIG_DIR | Out-Null
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

Native Windows `gh` otherwise defaults to its AppData directory, which Ralph
does not mount. Keep `GH_CONFIG_DIR` set when you invoke `ralph-ghafk` from this
PowerShell session; set it again before the invocation if you open a new one.
On Linux, macOS, and WSL, keep the exported `GH_CONFIG_DIR` in the same shell for
`gh auth status` and `ralph-ghafk`; export it again in a new shell before either
command. This pins `gh` to the configuration directory Ralph mounts even when
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` differs.

For `gh auth login` pick: `GitHub.com` → `HTTPS` → `Y` (authenticate Git) →
`Login with web browser`. Copy the one-time code, open
`https://github.com/login/device` in the host browser, paste it, and approve.

#### Verify back on the host

Verify the credentials for the provider you selected.

##### Claude credentials

Linux / macOS / WSL:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/.credentials.json ~/.claude.json
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "$HOME\.claude\.credentials.json","$HOME\.claude.json"
```

##### Codex credentials

```bash
codex login status
```

Because `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"`, verify that a successful login
also created the credential file without printing its reusable secret.

```bash
ls -la ~/.codex/auth.json
```

##### GitHub credentials (`ralph-ghafk` only)

Linux / macOS / WSL:

```bash
export GH_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/gh"
gh auth status
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:GH_CONFIG_DIR = "$HOME\.config\gh"
gh auth status
```

Run the matching command from the same shell context as Ralph. On PowerShell,
keep `GH_CONFIG_DIR` set for the subsequent `ralph-ghafk` invocation. These
commands verify the active GitHub account without displaying the reusable
credential stored in `hosts.yml`.

#### Re-login / token expired

Re-run `claude /login` inside the container, `codex login` from the matching host
shell, or the host `gh auth login` flow above as appropriate. Provider login
updates the selected provider's writable host store; host GitHub login updates
`~/.config/gh`, which Ralph later mounts read-only.

## `ralph-afk` — plan/PRD loop

### Usage

```bash
ralph-afk "<plan-and-prd>" <iterations>
```

(Or via the shim: `./node_modules/@daonhan/ralph/scripts/afk.sh "<plan-and-prd>" <iterations>`.)

Also supports:

- `ralph-afk --help` (or `-h`) — usage, flags, env vars.
- `ralph-afk --version` (or `-V`) — print bin + core version and exit.
- `ralph-afk --print-config` — print resolved workspace / docker context / image / docker-socket status / history dir and exit. Use for diagnostics before launching a real loop.

- `<plan-and-prd>` — a single string forwarded verbatim as `{{ INPUTS }}` in the template. Conventionally paths to plan and PRD files.
- `<iterations>` — max loop iterations. Exits early if implementer emits the sentinel.

### Example

```bash
ralph-afk "./docs/plans/inventory.md ./docs/prd/PRD-Inventory.md" 10
```

From PowerShell on Windows:

```powershell
wsl bash -c "ralph-afk './docs/plans/inventory.md ./docs/prd/PRD-Inventory.md' 10"
```

### What happens per iteration

1. **Render template** `packages/core/templates/afk.md`:
   - `` !?`git log -n 5 …|||No commits found` `` → recent commits (try-shell)
   - `{{ INPUTS }}` → the plan/PRD string
   - `@include:prompt.md` → the agent playbook (inlined by the Node renderer, no shell)
2. **Implementer stage** (gate) — `docker run ralph-sandbox <selected-agent> …` with the rendered prompt streamed in via a tempfile under `.ralph-tmp/` (avoids Windows 32 KB argv limit); a Claude stage runs `claude update` before its own command (see "Troubleshooting"). Provider events are normalized and rendered live; the terminal completion is captured.
3. **Sentinel check** — if the completion carries `<promise>NO MORE TASKS</promise>` on a line of its own, the loop skips the reviewer and exits 0; a mention inside prose does not stop the run.
4. **Reviewer stage** — runs `packages/core/templates/review.md`. Reads the HEAD commit (the `git show --stat` summary inline, the full patch spilled to `.ralph-tmp/spill-…/head.diff` via `@spill?:head.diff`), then either commits a `fix(review): …` patch or emits `<review>OK</review>` / `<review>SKIP</review>` and stops. Single pass; never amends the implementer's commit. It runs only when the implementer stage moved HEAD; otherwise the loop records a `skipped` history entry and starts no container.
5. **Run summary** — every non-signal exit (sentinel, iteration cap, failed stage) prints one stdout line with the reason, iterations completed, stages run and skipped, cost, tokens and wall time — e.g. `● Ralph ended · cap · 3/3 iterations · 5 stages (1 skipped) · $4.12 · 118.3k in / 9.6k out · 42m10s` — and the run's history file ends with a footer carrying the same totals: `--- ended · 3/3 iterations · cap · 5 stages (1 skipped) · $4.12 · 118.3k in / 9.6k out · 42m10s`.

## `ralph-ghafk` — GitHub-issue loop

### Usage

```bash
export GH_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/gh"
ralph-ghafk <iterations>
```

No plan/PRD arg — context comes from open GitHub issues.

### What happens per iteration

1. **Render template** `packages/core/templates/ghafk.md`:
   - `` !?`git log -n 5 …|||No commits found` `` → recent commits (try-shell)
   - `` !?`gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --json number,title,labels|||[]` `` → a lean inline index of open issues (number / title / labels)
   - `` @spill?:issues.json=`gh issue list … --json number,title,body,labels,comments` `` → full issue bodies + comments written to `.ralph-tmp/spill-…/issues.json`; the agent `Read`s that file before picking a task
   - `@include:ghprompt.md` → the agent playbook (inlined by the Node renderer, no shell)
2. **ghafk-implementer stage** (gate) — agent picks one open AFK issue, implements it, commits, closes / comments on the issue.
3. **Sentinel check** — same as `ralph-afk`.
4. **Reviewer stage** — same as `ralph-afk`.
5. **Run summary** — same as `ralph-afk`.

## Running AFK

Both bins are designed to chew through long runs unattended. Five AFK flags wire that up:

| Flag                | Default                                                 | What it does                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--no-keep-alive`   | off (wake-lock acquired)                                | Skip the OS wake-lock for the loop's lifetime.                           |
| `--max-retries <N>` | `3`                                                     | Per-stage retry budget on transient failures. `0` restores fail-fast.    |
| `--detach`          | off                                                     | Fork the loop into a background process, print pid + log path, and exit. |
| `--log <path>`      | `<workspace>/.ralph-tmp/logs/detached-<parent-pid>.log` | Override the detached log target. Only meaningful with `--detach`.       |
| `--notify`          | off                                                     | OS toast + terminal bell on loop completion or unrecoverable failure.    |

Canonical overnight recipe:

```bash
ralph-afk --detach --notify "<plan-and-prd>" 50
```

This forks into the background, holds an OS wake-lock so the host doesn't sleep, retries transient stage failures up to 3× with exponential backoff (`5s / 30s / 2m`), and raises a toast + bell when the run finishes (sentinel hit or iteration cap reached) or fails (signal, uncaught exception). Tail the log from any shell:

```bash
tail -f <workspace>/.ralph-tmp/logs/detached-*.log
```

Full per-OS notes (wake-lock mechanism, BurntToast install, WSL2 caveat, etc.) live in [`docs/keep-alive.md`](./docs/keep-alive.md).

---

## Consuming the package in another repo

### Global install (recommended — run from anywhere)

```bash
npm i -g @daonhan/ralph
```

After install, both bins are on your `$PATH`:

```bash
cd /path/to/some/workspace
ralph-afk "<plan-and-prd>" 5
ralph-ghafk 5
```

The bundled Dockerfile (shipped inside `@daonhan/ralph-core`) is the default `RALPH_DOCKER_CONTEXT`, so the `docker build` fallback works even when you invoke from a workspace that has no `Dockerfile` of its own.

### Per-repo install

```bash
# in your workspace repo
npm i -D @daonhan/ralph         # or: pnpm add -D @daonhan/ralph
./node_modules/.bin/ralph-afk "<plan-and-prd>" 5
```

### Bootstrap on demand (no install)

```bash
npx -y @daonhan/ralph ralph-afk "<plan-and-prd>" 5
```

### Environment variables

| Variable                     | Default                                                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Otherwise the sandbox gets container-local `node_modules` volumes at every package directory plus a shared package-manager store volume, so an install inside the container never rewrites the host tree.       |

## Local development (this monorepo)

Full contributor guide — dev loop, tests, adding a stage, releasing — lives in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**. The essentials:

```bash
pnpm install                          # links workspace, hoists devDeps
pnpm -r build                         # compiles packages/core/dist
pnpm -r typecheck                     # no-emit type check
pnpm -r test                          # packages/core runs `vitest run` (apps/cli has no tests)
pnpm test                             # root: `node --test` over scripts/*.test.mjs
```

A husky pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` (`prettier --ignore-unknown --write` on staged files) then `pnpm typecheck` on every commit.

### Build artifacts

- `packages/core/dist/` — compiled `.js` + `.d.ts`. Required for both `pnpm pack` and `pnpm publish`.
- `apps/cli` has no build step — bin shims are hand-written JS.

### Pack tarballs (smoke-test before publish)

```bash
(cd packages/core && pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp)
(cd apps/cli      && pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp)

# Install both in a throwaway repo to verify the published artifacts work
mkdir /tmp/ralph-test && cd /tmp/ralph-test
npm init -y
npm i -D /tmp/daonhan-ralph-core-*.tgz /tmp/daonhan-ralph-*.tgz
./node_modules/.bin/ralph-afk           # → prints usage
```

### Global install from local checkout (dev shortcut)

`pnpm link --global` is brittle inside this workspace (pnpm 9 rewrites the dependent's manifest). Use the pack-then-install path instead:

```bash
pnpm -r build
(cd packages/core && pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp/ralph-packs)
(cd apps/cli      && pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp/ralph-packs)
npm i -g /tmp/ralph-packs/daonhan-ralph-core-*.tgz \
         /tmp/ralph-packs/daonhan-ralph-*.tgz
ralph-afk          # → Usage: ralph-afk <plan-and-prd> <iterations>
```

Re-run after each source change. To uninstall: `npm uninstall -g @daonhan/ralph @daonhan/ralph-core`.

### Publish

Publishing is **automated** — you don't run `pnpm publish` by hand. Land work on `main` with [Conventional Commits](./RELEASING.md#3-conventional-commit-guide); [release-please](./.github/workflows/release-please.yml) opens one Release PR per component, and **merging that PR** cuts the component tag (`ralph-core-v*` / `ralph-v*` / `ralph-sandbox-v*`) that triggers [`publish-npm.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml) / [`publish-image.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-image.yml). See **[RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md)** for the full flow, required secrets, version policy, and rollback runbook.

Escape hatch (only if the pipeline is unavailable):

```bash
pnpm -r publish --access public   # topological order; workspace:^ rewritten to semver
```

### Use a local checkout in another repo (no publish)

Use the pack-then-install path above. It exposes `ralph-afk` / `ralph-ghafk` globally; no per-workspace step needed.

---

## Customizing the pipeline

### Add a stage

1. Add an entry to `STAGES` in `packages/core/src/stages.ts`:
   ```ts
   linter: { name: "linter", template: "lint.md", permissionMode: "bypassPermissions" } satisfies Stage,
   ```
2. Create `packages/core/templates/lint.md` using the same `` !`cmd` `` + `{{ INPUTS }}` syntax.
3. Wire it into the chain in `main.ts` / `gh-main.ts`:
   ```ts
   stages: [STAGES.implementer, STAGES.linter, STAGES.reviewer],
   ```
4. `pnpm -r build` and republish.

Only the first stage is the gate (sentinel-checked). Later stages run only when the gate stage moved HEAD; otherwise the loop records a `skipped` history entry for each and starts no container. Ralph runs the selected provider without interactive approval (`permissionMode: "bypassPermissions"` for Claude; `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for Codex). With the Docker socket disabled, persistent host-write exposure still includes the workspace mount and, for Claude, the read-write credential store (Codex credentials are mounted read-only); GitHub CLI config is read-only.

### Change the template syntax

Renderer is in `packages/core/src/render.ts`. Tags supported today:

- `` !`<shell cmd>` `` — executed via `bash` (Linux/macOS/WSL/Git Bash) or `cmd.exe` (Windows native fallback) with `cwd = workspaceDir`. stdout (trailing newline trimmed) replaces the tag. Failures throw and abort the iteration.
- `` !?`<shell cmd>|||<fallback>` `` — try-shell. Same as `!` but stderr is suppressed and a non-zero exit returns the literal fallback string. Use this for cross-platform safety — avoids depending on shell-specific `2>/dev/null || echo "…"` idioms.
- `` @spill[?]:<name>=`<shell cmd>[|||<fallback>]` `` — run `<cmd>` and write its **stdout to a file** `<name>` in the per-stage spill dir (`.ralph-tmp/spill-…/`), substituting the container-relative path `./.ralph-tmp/spill-…/<name>` into the prompt for the agent to `Read`. The `?` form suppresses stderr and writes `<fallback>` on non-zero exit; `<name>` must be a plain filename (no path separators, no `..`). Use for large outputs that would bloat the prompt — `review.md` spills the full HEAD patch, `ghafk.md` the full issue bodies.
- `@include:<rel-or-abs-path>` — inline a file (via Node `readFileSync`). Path resolved against the template's own directory when relative. No shell. Use this for bundled playbooks, not for live shell output.
- `{{ INPUTS }}` — replaced with the `inputs` field passed into `runLoop`.
- `{{ HISTORY }}` — replaced with the last ten stage entries from `<workspace>/.ralph/history/` (non-empty only for the implementer stage). Substituted last, alongside `{{ INPUTS }}`; carries prior agent output verbatim (same trust rule — never shelled).

Tags expand in a fixed order: `@include` → `@spill` → `!?` → `!` → `{{ INPUTS }}` → `{{ HISTORY }}`.

On Windows, the renderer prefers `bash.exe` (Git for Windows / WSL passthrough) over `cmd.exe`. The `!?` tag makes commands tolerant either way.

### Override the image

Set `RALPH_IMAGE=registry.example.com/my-image:tag` before invoking the shim, or edit the default in `packages/core/src/runner.ts`. The runner does `inspect` → `pull` → `build` against whatever ref is set; legacy `RALPH_IMAGE_TAG` still works for backward compatibility.

### Change feedback loops or task priority

The agent playbooks are self-contained: `packages/core/templates/prompt.md` (plan/PRD source + progress recording, for `ralph-afk`) and `ghprompt.md` (issue triage + close/comment, for `ralph-ghafk`). Each carries its own task-priority ladder, feedback loops, commit rules, and final rules. `afk.md` / `ghafk.md` each `@include` their respective playbook. Both playbooks also read the injected `{{ HISTORY }}` block before task selection (so a prior `failed` approach is not blindly retried) and end each turn with a short **Done / Blocked / Next** summary that is recorded to `.ralph/history/` and shown to the next iteration.

### Shipped skills

Ralph ships one [Agent Skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) of its own, `ralph-tdd` (`packages/core/templates/skills/ralph-tdd/`, adapted from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), MIT): test-driven implementation for an unattended iteration — one failing test, the minimum code to make it pass, one vertical slice at a time, tests at seams named up front and listed in the commit body. Both implementer playbooks tell the agent to use it for backend and library code and to implement frontend UI code directly.

It travels with the package, so it works on any host regardless of what you have installed (on Windows in particular, `~/.claude/skills` entries are usually junctions the container cannot follow). Every stage mounts the whole `templates/skills` directory **read-only** — Claude at `/home/agent/ralph-skills/.claude/skills`, with `--add-dir /home/agent/ralph-skills` added to the argv; Codex at `/home/agent/.agents/skills`, which it scans on its own. Both are container-local paths, so nothing is written to your home directory or your repo. The skill body is not pasted into the prompt: the agent sees the name and description and reads `SKILL.md` only when it uses it.

To add another, drop a directory with a `SKILL.md` beside `ralph-tdd/`, name it `ralph-<topic>` (matching the frontmatter `name`), reference it from a playbook, and republish — no runner or adapter change. Details: [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) "Adding a shipped skill".

## Stopping a run

- **Natural stop:** implementer emits `<promise>NO MORE TASKS</promise>` on a line of its own.
- **Manual stop:** `Ctrl+C`. `runLoop` installs `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` handlers that abort the active stage (via `AbortController`, killing the docker child), release the OS wake-lock, fire the `--notify` toast if enabled, and exit `130` (SIGINT) / `143` (SIGTERM). Tempfiles under `.ralph-tmp/.run-*.md` and the per-stage `spill-*/` dir are removed by the `finally` block in `runner.ts`; a hard `SIGKILL` may leave them — safe to delete, gitignored.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`Cannot find module '@daonhan/ralph-core'`** — `@daonhan/ralph` was installed but its dep didn't resolve. Re-run `npm install` (or `pnpm install`) in the workspace, or use `npx -y @daonhan/ralph` to let npx fetch a clean copy.
- **`@esbuild/win32-x64 package is present but this platform needs @esbuild/linux-x64`** — `node_modules/` installed from the wrong OS. Delete `node_modules/` + lockfile and reinstall under WSL.
- **`[warning] sandbox install rewrote the host node_modules`** — an agent inside the sandbox ran an install into the bind-mounted `node_modules/`, leaving a Linux tree behind: a pnpm store path under `/home/agent/`, Linux symlinks, and usually a stray `.pnpm-store/` at the workspace root. Both are gitignored, so `git status` still looks clean while every host command (`pnpm`, `tsc`, `vitest`, the pre-commit hook) fails. The run's history footer carries ` · warning: sandbox-install` too, so a finished run can be diagnosed after the fact. Container-local `node_modules` volumes ([#128](https://github.com/daonhan/ralph/issues/128)) prevent the rewrite by default everywhere but Linux — see the next entry — so this is a Linux-host or `RALPH_ISOLATE_NODE_MODULES=0` symptom. Reinstall on the host before running anything there:
  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, .pnpm-store -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; pnpm install
  ```
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules .pnpm-store && pnpm install
  ```
- **An empty `node_modules/` appears on the host, or an install run inside the sandbox is missing there** — expected. The sandbox mounts its own container-local `node_modules` over every package directory of the workspace (the root plus each nested `package.json`, up to four levels down), plus one shared package-manager store volume, so an install inside the container cannot rewrite the host tree. It is **on by default on Windows and macOS, off on Linux**, where one tree can serve host and container alike; `RALPH_ISOLATE_NODE_MODULES=0` shares the host tree again and `RALPH_ISOLATE_NODE_MODULES=1` isolates on Linux too. `ralph-afk --print-config` prints which is in effect. The first install per workspace is cold — nothing is copied in from the host — and is then cached in the volume for later runs. Docker creates each mountpoint, so an empty `node_modules/` directory may show up on the host; it is gitignored, stays empty, and is safe to delete. The volumes outlive the run — list and remove them with:
  ```bash
  docker volume ls --filter label=ralph.kind=node-modules --format '{{.Name}}  {{.Label "ralph.workspace"}}  {{.Label "ralph.path"}}'
  docker volume rm <name>…
  ```
  The shared store volume is `ralph-pm-store` (label `ralph.kind=pm-store`). They are named volumes, so a plain `docker volume prune` skips them (it removes only anonymous ones); `docker volume prune -a` clears them along with every other unused volume. The only cost is a cold install on the next run.
- **`docker  Checking for updates to latest version...` / `docker  Claude Code is up to date (2.1.267)` before every Claude stage** — expected. The Claude Code CLI baked into the image is a build-time snapshot while Claude Code releases roughly daily, so each Claude stage runs `claude update` before its own command (the report goes to stderr; stdout stays reserved for the stream-json Ralph decodes). The updated CLI lives in the named volume `ralph-claude-home`, mounted at `/home/agent/.local` and shared by every workspace and both bins on the host, so the first stage on a host pays one download (~200 MB, ~20–35 s) and every later stage costs a version check (~2 s). If the update fails (offline, registry down) the stage runs with whatever version is installed; two loops running at once on one host share the volume, and a concurrent update is a benign race. `RALPH_CLAUDE_UPDATE=0` disables both the update and the volume mount, so the stage runs the image's copy directly (the mount is dropped too — a stale volume would otherwise shadow a fresher image); `ralph-afk --print-config` shows a `claude update` row with what is in effect. Codex is unaffected. The volume outlives the run (label `ralph.kind=claude-home`, so it appears in `docker volume ls --filter label=ralph.kind`); remove it with `docker volume rm ralph-claude-home` — the only cost is one download on the next run.
- **`Not logged in · Please run /login`** — Claude credentials are missing inside the container. Run the interactive `docker run … claude /login` step from "First-run setup".
- **Codex reports that login is missing** — ensure `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"`, run `codex login` from the same shell environment as Ralph (per the same-shell rule), and confirm `codex login status` succeeds and `~/.codex/auth.json` exists in that environment's home.
- **Codex fails with `Operation not permitted (os error 1)` / `EPERM` at startup** — the container's `CODEX_HOME` is sitting on a Windows bind mount, which cannot host the unix socket and symlinks Codex creates at startup. Current Ralph avoids this by copying credentials into a container-local `CODEX_HOME`; upgrade `@daonhan/ralph` if you see this.
- **Codex config, MCP servers, or hooks are missing** — isolated Codex intentionally ignores `~/.codex/config.toml`; opt in with `--codex-user-config` and ensure configured commands and paths work inside Linux Docker.
- **An explicit Codex model fails** — fix or remove `RALPH_MODEL`. Ralph does not silently fall back to `gpt-5.6-sol` or another model after an explicit model failure.
- **The Claude stage fails on the model itself** (unknown model, or one your plan cannot use) — Ralph sent its own default because neither `RALPH_MODEL` nor your host `~/.claude/settings.json` pinned one. Run `ralph-afk --print-config` to see the model and where it came from, then set `RALPH_MODEL=<model you have access to>` or pick an explicit (non-"(default)") entry in `/model`.
- **`gh issue list` fails with `not a git repository`** — the workspace has no `.git`. The `ghafk.md` template uses `|| echo "[]"` fallback so the iteration still proceeds, but `gh` cannot detect the target repo. Initialize the repo, or push first.
- **`MSB3248` during `dotnet build` / `dotnet test`** — virtiofs/9p quirk on Windows-mounted source. The agent retries automatically per the recipe in `packages/core/templates/prompt.md`; manual repro:
  ```bash
  dotnet test <path-to-test-csproj> \
    -m:1 \
    /p:UseSharedCompilation=false \
    /p:BuildInParallel=false \
    /p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=/tmp/ralph-obj/<name>/ \
    /p:BaseOutputPath=/tmp/ralph-bin/<name>/
  ```
- **`docker run` exit 1 with no selected-agent output** — image stale. Force refresh:
  ```bash
  docker rmi docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest
  docker pull docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest
  ```
- **`docker pull failed … and no Dockerfile at …`** — the default image ref isn't reachable (offline, registry down, or you set a custom `$RALPH_IMAGE` that doesn't exist) AND no Dockerfile is at `$RALPH_DOCKER_CONTEXT`. Fix one of: connectivity, `RALPH_IMAGE`, or place a Dockerfile at `$RALPH_DOCKER_CONTEXT`.
- **`pull access denied … repository does not exist`** — `$RALPH_IMAGE` points at a private repo or a typo. Either `docker login`, switch to a public image, or unset `RALPH_IMAGE` to use the default.
- **Loop hangs after a stage's final assistant message (no next iteration, no error)** — the selected CLI inside the sandbox emitted its completion event but failed to exit. After `RALPH_RESULT_GRACE_MS` (default 30000ms), the runner kills the lingering docker child, keeps the captured completion, and continues the loop. Bump or disable the timer via the environment when diagnosing. To inspect or stop the container manually before the timer expires:
  ```bash
  docker ps --filter ancestor=docker.io/daonhan/ralph-sandbox:latest
  docker kill <container-id>
  ```
  The sandbox runs with `--rm`, so the container is removed after it exits.
